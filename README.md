# 💻 Hi, I'm Heiko Ries

I'm a career changer specializing in **Cloud Infrastructure Engineering**, with a technical background and leadership experience as a team and training manager in mechanical engineering.  

My focus is on **AWS, networking, security, monitoring, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**.  
Through my [Cloud Portfolio](https://github.com/Hikko218/Cloud-Portfolio-AWS), I demonstrate how to design, build, and automate production-ready cloud architectures.

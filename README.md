# 💻 Hi, I'm Heiko Ries

I'm a career changer in web development with a technical background and leadership experience  
as a team and training manager in mechanical engineering.

Starting with modern full-stack development (**Next.js**, **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma**),  
I am now expanding my skill set into **Cloud Engineering with AWS** to build scalable, secure, and production-ready applications.
